# bloop `v1.6.0`

Bloop v1.6.0 introduces support for best effort compilation in Scala 3, which
can be used by build servers to provide better feedback when code is not
compiling. It will create separate artifacts in that case, which only the
compiler understands and can use to type check your code that depends on the
broken code.

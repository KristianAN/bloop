# bloop `v2.0.0-RC1`

Bloop v2.0.0-RC1 is a new major release, which changes a number release
artifacts and the way Bloop clients should connect to the server.

Specifically:

- launcher, bloopgun, sockets modules have been removed
- bloop-rifle module has been added, which is responsible for starting the Bloop
  server and connecting to it
- cli module has been added, which produces the native image binary so that
  Bloop can be used from command line
- Bloop will now use named sockets added in JDK 16 as the primary way of
  communicating with clients. This means Bloop itself will only run with JDK 16
  or higher now, however all needed flags have been added previously, so that
  code compiles with the correct version of JDK in mind.

If you use Bloop in your tools, do let us know and we can help you integrate
with the new changes.

# bloop `v1.5.12`

Bloop v1.5.12 is mostly a bugfix release, however some improvements were added,
which includes:

- Support for BSP's buildTargetDependencyModules by
  [Arthurm1](https://github.com/Arthurm1).
- Always show full stack traces coming from the compiler.
- Automatically add -release option when needed, which will make sure that the
  right JDK is used to compile your project by the Scala compiler.
